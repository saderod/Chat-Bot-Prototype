# Chat-Bot-Prototype
This Chat Bot prototype is a prototype that learn how to communicate with another person via text and emulate someone / make someone think they are a real person. First you need to upload a conversation example of someone or a character you want the bot to communicate as. Then you can also change the "backup responses" and "trigger words" to fit what the bot should text back in situations where it is exposed to conversations that it has not trained on before. Lastly, to quit the conversation, you can type in quit in the chat box to stop the bot. "Do Not Disturb" mode is when the bot has the option to ask the user (the person who is in control of the bot) what to sa in situations it does not know. When it is On means that it will use back up responses and when it is Off means that it will ask the user when stuck in a conversation. This bot is very customizable to fit the character you want it play or talk like the person you want it to emulate.
